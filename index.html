            Before Bay Area, I lived in Reno, Nevada for 12 year. And before that, I was in my hometown, Tokyo, Japan. 
            Yup I am Japanese but I am not samurai or ninjya.

                    Born and raised in Tokyo. When I was 17 years olds, all of my friends started to look which university they go, 
                    I suddenly realized I did not want to go any of them. Rather, I wanted to go out of Japan and study in USA. My parents, of course, did not approve first, 
                    but I was so determined with my dream. It was not too hard to convince them because after all, they would support as long as I am seriously dreaming about it. 
                    On 2001, I landed USA for first time!!

                        Do you love food? Well I do!! I am a restaurant general manager. I have been in this industry for 10 years now. 
                        It is very exciting and fun industry to be in. I started as a server at very small Japanese restaurant. 
                        Did not think I would stay this industry for long time but here I am,
