Rithm School Pre work 1

This is one of pre work for rithm school

Knowledge that I had was very limited.
And quite frankly, I did not know what I was doing.


This website is very badly written and styled. 
I am not proud of it. I was almost rewrote it or delete this project 

However, I decided to keep this project as it is.
Because it can showcase how well I can learn in short period of time by comparing other projects
that I have build in school.

Still, I know only tip of iceburg about web development. And I know I will hit wall of difficult problems
and I may loose faith in me. 

But I will have courage to keep pushing myself to move forward and trust my ability to learn by
looking at this project.

So I will keep this project as my lucky charm.

Thank you for reading this most non techical readme ever.

Happy coding!
